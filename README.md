## History

After working on a play.next game I decided to try and remove some of the UI and state(betModel, slotModel) complexity in our games.
Areas I'm trying to target are:

1. Menus
2. Menu overlays(settings, paytables)
3. Bet and Autoplay consoles
4. Bet, Autoplay, Spin, buttons
5. Info bar
6. betModel
7. slotModel
8. gameRepoModel
