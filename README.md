## History

After working on a play.next game I decided to try and remove some of the UI and state(betModel, slotModel) complexity in our games.
Areas I'm trying to target are:

1. Menus
2. Menu overlays(settings, paytables)
3. Free Games
4. Bet and Autoplay consoles
5. Bet, Autoplay, Spin, buttons
6. Info bar
7. betModel
8. slotModel
9. gameRepoModel
